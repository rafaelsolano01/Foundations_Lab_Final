## Introduction

Hello World. This repository serves as my professional technical portfolio for the 24-week Cybersecurity Foundations Intensive [4, 5]. Establishing this workbench and pushing this initial commit formally verifies my Git authentication mechanics and confirms my digital presence within the 2026 cybersecurity ecosystem [1, 6]. This repository will serve as a centralized hub for my version-controlled documentation, technical labs, and professional growth as I transition from a "student" consumer of information into a "professional practitioner" [7-10].

*   **Remote Portfolio Hub:** GitHub [18, 20, 21]

## Security Foundations: Governance & Frameworks

### The CIA Triad: The "Why" of Security
Think of this as the three-legged stool of data. If one leg breaks, the whole system collapses.

Confidentiality: Keeping secrets. Only authorized people see the data. (Example: Using encryption so a hacker can’t read your emails).

Integrity: Keeping data accurate. Ensuring the info hasn't been tampered with or corrupted. (Example: A digital signature that proves a contract wasn't changed after you signed it).

Availability: Keeping the lights on. Ensuring systems work when users need them. (Example: Preventing a DDoS attack from taking down a hospital's patient records).

## The AAA Framework: The "How" of Access
This is the process of managing a user from the moment they "knock" on the digital door to the moment they leave.

Authentication (Are you who you say you are?): This is your login—ideally using phishing-resistant MFA like a FIDO2 key.

Authorization (What are you allowed to do?): Once inside, this limits your reach. You shouldn't have "Admin" rights if you only need to read a spreadsheet (Principle of Least Privilege).

Accounting (What did you do?): This is the paper trail. It creates Non-repudiation, meaning a user cannot deny they performed an action because the immutable logs prove it was them.

## How Governance Shapes Your Career
In 2026, cybersecurity is no longer just a "tech" problem; it is a business risk managed by the Govern function of NIST CSF 2.0. Governance dictates the rules of engagement for every role. If you are a SOC Analyst, governance defines your incident response timelines; if you are a Cloud Architect, it dictates the compliance standards (like HIPAA or GDPR) you must build into your infrastructure. Without governance, security is just a series of random "fixes" without a blueprint, leading to Drift—where your security posture gets weaker over time because there’s no policy holding it in place.

## Reflection: Why Governance Matters
Technical skills are the tools, but governance is the blueprint. You can build the strongest firewall in the world, but if there’s no policy (Governance) telling employees not to share passwords, the tech fails. In 2026, governance ensures that security isn't just a "IT thing" but a legal requirement that keeps the company from getting sued or shut down.

## Domain Alignment: GRC
The GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance) domain aligns most with today’s material. While Cloud and Network teams use the CIA Triad and AAA, the GRC team writes the rules that require them. They ensure the organization stays within the lines of the law and industry standards.
